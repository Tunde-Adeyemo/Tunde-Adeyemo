- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tunde-Adeyemo
-I’m interested in physics, electronics and everything.
- I have worked in water resources  and environmental engineering in the past and have been a physics 
and maths lecturer. 
- 💞️ I’m still looking for titbits that keep my brain active and exercise my programming skills. I have only recenlty discovered the 
fantastic availability, versatility, practicability,applicability, compactness and economy of micrcontrollers.
my github is a public repository of some of my ideas that I have worked to execution.

- 📫 I am easily contacted through my email olat.adeyemo@gmail.com to ensure you get my attention you may use 
"reference Github" in the title of your correspondence.
